## Lighting the Christ's candle

All things bright and beautiful,

all creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful,

the Lord God made them all

---

The cold wind in the winter,

the bright life-giving sun

The ripe fruits in the garden, 

God made them everyone

---

All things bright and beautiful,

all creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful,

the Lord God made them all

---

The wildflowers in their beauty,

the mountain ranges tall

The billabongs and rivers 

and friendly birds that call

---

All things bright and beautiful,

all creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful,

the Lord God made them all

---

The coloured walls of gorges,

the gum trees green and tall

The rocks, and pools, and palm trees, 

the sparkling waterfall

---

All things bright and beautiful,

all creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful,

the Lord God made them all

---

The many-coloured corals, 

the creatures of the sea

Of bushland, field or desert, 

on farms, or roaming free

---

All things bright and beautiful,

all creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful,

the Lord God made them all

---

God gave us eyes to see them,

and lips that we might tell

How great is God Almighty 

who has made all things well.

### Acknowledgment of Country

**This land is God’s land and God’s Spirit dwells here. We acknowledge the Gadigal People, traditional custodians of this land under God.**

We commit ourselves again to working for reconciliation in this land.

---

**Come to us, God of unity. Come with your forgiveness and your healing grace. Come, that we may witness to reconciliation in a divided world; that we may gather around Christ’s table as one people; that we may affirm one Church, one faith, one Lord.**

Come to us, God of unity.

---

**God of power and justice, like Jeremiah you weep over those who wander from you, turn aside to other gods, and enter into chaos and destruction. By your tears and through your mercy, teach us your ways and write them on our hearts so that we may follow faithfully the path you show us.**

Amen.

## Prayers of the people

---

Creator God,

you call us to love and serve you

with body, mind, and spirit

through loving your creation

and our sisters and brothers.

---


Open our hearts in compassion

and receive these petitions

on behalf of the needs of the church and the world.


---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; feel quite at home,

close to my heart, loved and forgiven.

Come as you are: why stand alone?


---

No need to fear, love sets no limits;

no need to fear, love never ends;

don’t run away shamed and disheartened,

rest in my love, trust me again.

---

I came to call sinners, not just the righteous;

I came to bring peace, not to condemn.

Each time you fail to live by my promise,

why do you think I’d love you the less?

---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; trust me again.

Nothing can change the love that I bear you;

all will be well, just come as you are.

`Deidre Browne, 1936`

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth.

---

Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best.

---

For you are the heart of the kindom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.

**As we break this bread and share this wine:**

We receive a God who is at the centre of our brokenness and the brokenness of the world, and we drink a cup which we all hold in common.

---

**As we wait in faith for the healing love of Christ:**

We sing of a dream of reborn hope and the power of love.

---

We thank you, gracious God,

That we are the guests at your table.

As we have been fed by your gifts of life,

So we will share with the world

All that you give us in love.
