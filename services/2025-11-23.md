Come to be our hope, O Jesus,

come to set our people free.

From oppression, come, release us,

you alone give liberty.

---

Come release from every prison

those who suffer in our land.

In your love we find the reason

still to live and understand.

---

Come to build your new creation;

show the way of servanthood;

give new life to every nation,

changing evil into good.

---

Come and open our tomorrow

for a kingdom, now so near.

Take away all human sorrow,

give us hope against our fear.

---

> **Let us pray:**

> God of all mercy, give us grace today to make a fresh start. 

> We know we have not loved you with our whole heart, nor have we loved our neighbour as ourselves. 

---

> As we hope to be forgiven, teach us how to forgive; and lead us forward in a new life where neither grudges nor resentment have a part; through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

> Amen.

---

> Lord Jesus Christ, King above all kings and Lord of all creation,
> we come before You with hearts full of gratitude and awe.
> Your kingdom is not built on power or wealth,
> but on truth, mercy, and love without end.

---

> Reign in our hearts,
> that our thoughts, words, and actions may reflect Your justice and peace.


> Reign in our homes,
> that forgiveness may replace resentment, and compassion may overcome division.

---

> Reign in our world, that the oppressed may find freedom, the weary may find rest,
> and all may know the joy of Your salvation.

> Amen.

## Prayers of the people

> hear our prayer.

God of freedom, God of justice,

God whose love is strong as death,

God who saw the dark of prison,

God who knew the price of faith:

touch our world of sad oppression

with your Spirit's healing breath.

---

Rid the earth of torture's terror,

God whose hands were nailed to wood;

hear the cries of pain and protest,

God who shed the tears and blood;

move in us the power of pity,

restless for the common good.

---

Make in us a captive conscience

quick to hear, to act, to plead;

make us truly sisters, brothers

of whatever race or creed:

teach us to be fully human,

open to each other's need.

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth.

---

Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best.

---

For you are the heart of the kindom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.
