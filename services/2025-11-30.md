## Prayers of the people

> hear our prayer.

Make me a channel of Your peace

Where there is hatred, let me bring Your love

Where there is injury, Your pardon Lord

And where there's doubt, true faith in You

---

Make me a channel of Your peace

Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope

Where there is darkness, only light

And where there's sadness, ever joy

---

Oh master, grant that I may never seek

So much to be consoled as to console

To be understood as to understand

To be loved as to love with all my soul

---

Make me a channel of Your peace

It is in pardoning that we are pardoned

In giving to all men that we receive

And in dying that we're born into eternal life

---

Oh master, grant that I may never seek

So much to be consoled as to console

To be understood as to understand

To be loved as to love with all my soul

---

Make me a channel of Your peace

Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope

Where there is darkness, only light

And where there's sadness ever joy

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth.

---

Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best.

---

For you are the heart of the kindom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.

## Announcements

---

Community of Christ,

who make the Cross your own,

live out your creed and risk your life

for God alone:

the God who wears your face,

to whom all worlds belong,

whose children are of every race

and every song.

---

Community of Christ,

look past the Church's door

and see the refugee, the hungry,

and the poor.

Take hands with the oppressed,

the jobless in your street,

take towel and water, that you wash

your neighbour's feet.

---

Community of Christ,

through whom the word must sound -

cry out for justice and for peace

the whole world round:

disarm the powers that war

and all that can destroy,

turn bombs to bread, and tears of anguish into joy.

---

When menace melts away,

so shall God's will be done,

the climate of the world be peace

and Christ its Sun;

our currency be love

and kindliness our law,

our food and faith be shared as one

for evermore.

---
