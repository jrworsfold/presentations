### Acknowledgment of Country

**This land is God’s land and God’s Spirit dwells here. We acknowledge the Gadigal People, traditional custodians of this land under God.**

We commit ourselves again to working for reconciliation in this land.

---

Merciful God, our maker and our judge, we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed, and in what we have failed to do: we have not loved you with our whole heart, we have not loved our neighbours as ourselves; we repent, and are sorry for all our sins. 

---

Father, forgive us. Strengthen us to love and obey you in newness of life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

Amen.

---

Now to him who loved us, gave us every pledge that love could give, freely shed his blood to save us, gave his life that we might live, be the kingdom and dominion and the glory evermore.

Amen.

---

**In your love, O God of hosts, your people find healing.**

**Grant that the pains of our journey may not obscure**
**the presence of Christ among us, but that we may always give thanks for your healing power as we travel on the way to your kingdom.**

**We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord.** Amen.

---

We believe in one God,
the Father, the Almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all that is, seen and unseen.

---

We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
the only Son of God,
eternally begotten of the Father,
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made,
of one Being with the Father;
through him all things were made.

---

For us and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary
and became truly human.

---

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
he suffered death and was buried.

On the third day he rose again
in accordance with the Scriptures;

he ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

---

He will come again in glory
to judge the living and the dead,
and his kingdom will have no end.

---

We believe in the Holy Spirit,
the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son
is worshipped and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.

---

We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.

We look for the resurrection of the dead,
and the life of the world to come. 

Amen
