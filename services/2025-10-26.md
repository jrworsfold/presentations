### Acknowledgment of Country

> **This land is God’s land and God’s Spirit dwells here. We acknowledge the Gadigal People, traditional custodians of this land under God.**

> We commit ourselves again to working for reconciliation in this land.

---

> **Come to us, God of unity. Come with your forgiveness and your healing grace.**
> **Come, that we may witness to reconciliation in a divided world; that we may gather around Christ’s table as one people; that we may affirm one Church, one faith, one Lord.**

> Come to us, God of unity.

---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; feel quite at home,

close to my heart, loved and forgiven.

Come as you are: why stand alone?


---

No need to fear, love sets no limits;

no need to fear, love never ends;

don’t run away shamed and disheartened,

rest in my love, trust me again.

---

I came to call sinners, not just the righteous;

I came to bring peace, not to condemn.

Each time you fail to live by my promise,

why do you think I’d love you the less?

---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; trust me again.

Nothing can change the love that I bear you;

all will be well, just come as you are.

`Deidre Browne, 1936`

> **Let us pray:**

> God of all mercy, give us grace today to make a fresh start. 

> We know we have not loved you with our whole heart, nor have we loved our neighbour as ourselves. 

---

> As we hope to be forgiven, teach us how to forgive; and lead us forward in a new life where neither grudges nor resentment have a part; through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

> Amen.

## Prayers of the people

> **Lord, in your mercy,**

> hear our prayer.

God gives us a future daring us to go,

into dreams and dangers on a path unknown.

We will face tomorrow in the Spirit’s power.

We will let God change us, for new life starts now.

---

We must leave behind us sins of yesterday,

for God’s new beginning is a better way.

Fear and doubt and habit must not hold us back,

God gives hope, and insight and the strength we lack.


---

Holy Spirit, teach us how to read the signs,

how to meet the challenge of our troubled times.

Love us into action, stir us into prayer,

till we choose God’s life and find our future there.

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth.

---

Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best.

---

For you are the heart of the kingdom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.

May the feet of God walk with you

and his hand hold you tight

May the eye of God rest on you

and his ear hear your cry.
