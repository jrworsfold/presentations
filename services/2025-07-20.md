<!-- <section data-background-image="assets/candle.jpg"> -->

This morning as we gather to worship, we light the candle with these words.

**Light of the world, show us our neighbours**

In this season of Lent, may we ask ourselves the question 

---

“who is my neighbour” and struggle to answer with action.

**Light of the World, show us how to love our neighbours.**

**Guide us to see You in strangers.  Amen.**



<!-- </section> -->

---

Here in this place, we can ask big questions.

**Who is my neighbour?**

**How can I help?**

**What do I have to learn?**

**Where is God in it all?**


---

Here in this place, we can ask big questions.

**So may we listen.**

**May we learn.**

**May we stay curious, and may we look for God.**

Longing for light, we wait in darkness.

Longing for truth, we turn to you.

Make us your own, your holy people,

light for the world to see.

---

Christ be our light

Shine in our hearts

Shine through the darkness

Christ be our light

Shine in your church gathered today.

---

Longing for peace, our world is troubled

Longing for hope many despair

Your word alone has pow’r to save us

Make us your living voice.

---

Christ be our light

Shine in our hearts

Shine through the darkness

Christ be our light

Shine in your church gathered today.

---

Longing for food, many are hungry

Longing for water, many still thirst

Make us your bread, broken for others

Shared until all are fed.

---

Christ be our light

Shine in our hearts

Shine through the darkness

Christ be our light

Shine in your church gathered today.

---

Longing for shelter, many are homeless

Longing for warmth, many are cold

Make us your building, sheltering others,

Walls made of living stone.

---

Christ be our light

Shine in our hearts

Shine through the darkness

Christ be our light

Shine in your church gathered today.

---

Many the gifts, many the people

Many the hearts, that yearn to belong

Let us be servants to one another,

Making your kingdom come.

---

Christ be our light

Shine in our hearts

Shine through the darkness

Christ be our light

Shine in your church gathered today.

---

...Must we have compassion for our enemy?

**Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy…**

Forgive our human tendency to create exceptions in the face of love. 
    
**Christ have mercy, Christ have mercy, Christ have mercy….**

---

Rewire our hearts so that we might see the face of a neighbour in every stranger we pass. 
    
**Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy.**

---

Family of faith, when we set limits on love,

**God loves extravagantly.**

When we forget that we are neighbours,

**God claims us as God’s own**

When we judge, hold back, or harm,

**God surrounds us with grace.**

---

There is nothing we can do or leave undone that could separate us from the love of God.

This is the good news of the gospel. 

**Thanks be to God! Amen.**

## Go and do likewise


---

Kneels at the feet of his friends,

silently washes their feet,

Master who acts as a slave to them.

Jesu, Jesu, fill us with your love,

show us how to serve the neighbours we have from you.

---

Neighbours are wealthy and poor,

varied in color and race,

neighbuors are near us and far away.

Jesu, Jesu, fill us with your love,

show us how to serve the neighbours we have from you.

---

These are the ones we should serve,

these are the ones we should love,

all these are neighbours to us and you.
      
Jesu, Jesu, fill us with your love,

show us how to serve the neighbours we have from you.

---

Loving puts us on our knees,

silently washing their feet,

this is the way we should live with you.

Jesu, Jesu, fill us with your love,

show us how to serve the neighbours we have from you.


---

<section data-background-image="assets/prayers.jpg">

The world cries to us in hurt and pain.

**We shall be neighbour in service, reconciliation and compassion, whenever we can, in the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.**

**is now and ever shall be. Amen**
