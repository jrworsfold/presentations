Sing of the God who loves you.

Raise your joyful cries,

Dance to the life around you.

Come, O God of snow and rain;

shower down upon the earth.

Come, O God of joy and pain;

God of sorrow, God of mirth.

Sing out, earth and skies!

Sing of the God who loves you.

Dance to the life around you.

Come, O Justice, come, O Peace;

come and shape our hearts anew.

Come and make oppression

bring us all to life in you.

> God of all mercy, give us grace today to make a fresh start. 

> We know we have not loved you with our whole heart, nor have we loved our neighbour as ourselves. 

---

> As we hope to be forgiven, teach us how to forgive; and lead us forward in a new life where neither grudges nor resentment have a part; through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

> Amen.

---

> God of faithful surprises, throughout the ages you have made known your love and power in unexpected ways and places.

> May we daily perceive the joy and wonder of your abiding presence and offer our lives in gratitude for our redemption. Amen.
