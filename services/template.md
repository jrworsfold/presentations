Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth. \
Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best. \
For you are the heart of the kingdom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.
