Father and Mother of us all, may all proclaim your worth.

Your kingdom come, your will be honoured 

in heaven and on Earth.

Give us today the things we need, 

our shelter, our money, our food. 

Forgive us our debts as we agree to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us or put us to the test.

Save us from faults or compromise 

that would rob us of our best.

For you are the heart of the kingdom, 

your power and glory extend

through time and space forever and ever, and so shall it be. 

Amen.

This is the place and this is the time;​

**HERE AND NOW GOD WAITS​ TO BREAK INTO OUR EXPERIENCE​**

To change our minds. To change our lives,

**TO CHANGE OUR WAYS​**

To make us see the world​. And the whole of life in a new light.​

**TO FILL US WITH HOPE, JOY ​AND CERTAINTY FOR THE FUTURE​**




---

Protect me, God,​

**You are my place of refuge.​**

I’m acknowledging you ​as the one in charge, Lord;​

**you are the best thing that’s ever happened to me.**

I delight in the company of those​ who dedicate themselves to you;

**they are the salt of the earth.​**

Those who worship other things​ will have nothing but grief.​

**I will not buy into their futile devotions;​ I will not utter the names they revere.​**

---

You are all I want, Lord, and all I need;​

you hold my future in your hands. ​

You mark out the best of everything for me;​

you’ve set me up with a bright future.​

I heap accolades on you, Lord,​ for you always give me wise advice;​
even in the dead of night​ you fill my heart with your teachings. ​

---

I’ll never be pushed off track. ​

You fill me with delight, Lord;​

joy erupts from deep in my bones;​

my body relaxes, safe in your care.

You set my feet on a life-giving track, Lord.​

To be in your presence is absolute bliss.​

All I could dream of comes from your hand. ​

God sends us his Spirit ​

to befriend and help us,​

re-created and guide us, Spirit-friend.​

Spirit who enlivens, sanctifies, enlightens​

sets us free, is now our Spirit-friend.​

Spirit of our Father, Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of our Jesus, Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of God’s people, Spirit-friend.

---

Darkened roads are clearer,​

heavy burdens lighter​

when we’re walking with our Spirit-friend:​

now we need not fear ​

the powers of the darkness:​

none can overcome our Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of our Mother, Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of our Jesus, Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of God’s people, Spirit-friend.​

---

Now we are God’s people, 

bonded by God’s presence,​

agents of God’s purpose, Spirit-friend:​

lead us forward ever,​

slipping backward never,​

To your re-made world, our Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of Creator, Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of our Jesus, Spirit-friend,​

Spirit of God’s people, Spirit-friend.​
