## Lighting the Christ's candle

---

God has spoken by the prophets,

spoken the unchanging Word,

each from age to age proclaiming

God, the one, the righteous Lord!

---


'Mid the world's despair and turmoil

one firm anchor holding fast:

God eternal reigns forever,

God the first and God the last.

---

God has spoken by Christ Jesus,

Christ, the everlasting Son,

brightness of  creation’s glory,

with Father Mother ever one;

---

spoken by the Word incarnate,

God of God, ere time was born;

Light of light, to earth descending,

Christ, as God in human form.

---

God is speaking by the Spirit,

speaking to our hearts again;

in the age-long Word declaring

God's own message, now as then.

---

Through the rise and fall of nations

one sure faith yet standing fast:

God abides, the Word unchanging,

God the first and God the last.

---

> **The grace of our Saviour Jesus Christ, the love of God and the friendship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.**

> And also with you.

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth.

---

Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best.

---

For you are the heart of the kindom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.
