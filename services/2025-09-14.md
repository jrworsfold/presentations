## Water Sunday

**Bujari gamarruwa ...**

**Yaama ...**

**Malo e lelei ...**

---
**Did you know that all the water we have today, is all the water we’ve ever had?**

**Thank you Nori for the insight that we bath in and drink the same water that dinosaurs pee out!**

**Our world never gets water added to it, nor is water, not even a drop, ever lost from it.**

---

**Its constantly recycled in a process known as hydrologic.**

**Precipitation; Runoff; Infiltration; Percolation; Evaporation; Transpiration; Condensation…**

**Water is the necessary ingredient for life.**

---

**However…only 3-3.5% of the earth’s water is freshwater that we can drink.**

**Most of that is also inaccessible as its locked up in glaciers or icecaps or stored deep underground.**

**Of the total freshwater only about 1% is in liquid form, in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere. It is a very precious commodity.**

> **In the beginning God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light,**

> and God saw that the light was good.

---

**Come let us worship God..**

We come in the name of the Word of God

who parted the waters for Earth to appear

We come in the name of the Wisdom of God,

who filled the deeps with amazing designs

and sustains us all with waters of life.

---

Morning has broken, like the first morning

Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird

Praise for the singing, praise for the morning

Praise for them springing fresh from the Word.

---

Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven

Like the first dewfall, on the first grass

Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden

Sprung in completeness where His feet pass.

---

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning

Born of the one light, Eden saw play

Praise with elation, praise every morning

God's recreation of the new day.

### Acknowledgement of Country

**This land is God’s land and God’s Spirit dwells in the lands and waters of Waterloo and Redfern.**

---

**We remember today the Cook’s River, Goolay’yari, Place of Pelican Dreaming; Sydney Cove, Warrang, and Yununrala, the harbour foreshore and the the deep ways in which Gadigal people walked and lived with this place. May we be mindful of the calling God places on humanity to care for Creation.**

---

**May we take the lead from the Gadigal People, elders past and present, whose stories are entwined with the caring of this place and waters.**

May we learn from them and walk with them towards treaty, truth telling and justice.

Beauty for brokenness

Hope for despair

Lord, in your suffering

This is our prayer

Bread for the children

Justice, joy, peace

Sunrise to sunset

Your kingdom increase!

---

Shelter for fragile lives

Cures for their ills

Work for the craftsman

Trade for their skills

Land for the dispossessed

Rights for the weak

Voices to plead the cause

Of those who can't speak

---



God of the poor

Friend of the weak

Give us compassion we pray

Melt our cold hearts

Let tears fall like rain

Come, change our love

From a spark to a flame

---

Refuge from cruel wars

Havens from fear

Cities for sanctuary

Freedoms to share

Peace to the killing-fields

Scorched earth to green

Christ for the bitterness

His cross for the pain

---

Rest for the ravaged earth

Oceans and streams

Plundered and poisoned

Our future, our dreams

Lord, end our madness

Carelessness, greed

Make us content with

The things that we need

---

Lighten our darkness

Breathe on this flame

Until your justice

Burns brightly again

Until the nations

Learn of your ways

Seek your salvation

And bring you their praise

## Prayers of the people

## Announcements

---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; feel quite at home,

close to my heart, loved and forgiven.

Come as you are: why stand alone?


---

No need to fear, love sets no limits;

no need to fear, love never ends;

don’t run away shamed and disheartened,

rest in my love, trust me again.

---

I came to call sinners, not just the righteous;

I came to bring peace, not to condemn.

Each time you fail to live by my promise,

why do you think I’d love you the less?

---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; trust me again.

Nothing can change the love that I bear you;

all will be well, just come as you are.

`Deidre Browne, 1936`

### Invitation to communion

**The peace of the risen Christ be always with you**

And also with you.

---

**The Lord be with you**

And also with you

**Lift up your hearts**

We lift them to the Lord

**Let us give thanks to the Lord our God,**

It is right to give our thanks and praise



---

**For what, God of the waters, do we give you thanks?**

For Sister Water, so necessary for life, and all who dwell in her depths;

for fish and eels and dolphins and whales;

For Gadigal custodians of river and sea; Barangaroo and her sisters;

For the wisdom of desert mothers and waters of life in the wilderness

---

**For what, loving God do we give you thanks?**

The movement of your Spirit within our lives

which calls us to love you, ourselves, and one another.

---

**For what, creative God, do we give you thanks?**

Your gifts of friendship, with people and all creatures

Your gifts of yourself – shown to us in Jesus and those in whom we find him.

---

**For what, compassionate God, do we give you thanks?**

The knowledge that you are with us in everything

In the highs and lows of our lives

you celebrate and grieve with us.

---

**For what, generous God, do we give you thanks?**

This meal which we are about to share.

This meal where you offer us not just, bread, not just wine

but your very self – given to us through your son Jesus

---

**Through this offering of yourself**

We can know ourselves filled, forgiven, healed, blessed

and made new again.

`Betty Stroud`

---

Holy, holy, holy Lord,

Wisdom, Strength and love

heaven and earth are full of your glory.

Hosanna in the highest.

Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord

Hosanna in the highest!
---

**Loving God, as we come to share the richness of your table**

**we cannot forget the rawness of the earth.** 

**We cannot take bread and forget those who are hungry.**

---

**Your world is one world and we are stewards of its nourishment.**

Lord, put our prosperity 

at the service of the poor.

---

**We cannot take wine**

**and forget those who are thirsty.**

**The ground and the rootless,**

**the earth and its weary people cry out for justice.**

Lord, put our fullness 

at the service of the empty.

---

**We cannot hear your words of peace and forget the world at war.**

Show us quickly, Lord, 

how to turn weapons into welcome signs

and the lust for power 

into a desire for peace.

---

**We cannot celebrate the feast of your family**

**and forget our divisions.**

**We are one in spirit, but not in fact.**

**History and hurt still dismember us.**

Lord, heal your church

in every brokenness.

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth.

---

Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best.

---

For you are the heart of the kingdom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.

God-with-Earth,

invited and fed at your table we are remade, repurposed.

May this food empower us to cherish your Creation who we also are.

---

And whether our cares be light or heavy, our song be strong or weak,

keep our hearts warm, our hands open,

our lives ever embracing and embraced by your love,

Amen

---

**God spoke light into the void**

and the light is in our hands against the darkness.

**God clothed the world with sky**

and we ride upon the wind

and breath among the leaves.

---

**God gifted us with earth and with water in between.**

We dig and float and drink and grow

and know the power of earth and sea.

We paint and sing and work and dance

in company with God.

---

**We share the earth with all that is**

**in harmonies of warm and cold,**

in green and desert,

**crowd and lone,**

we feel the pain,

---

**we feel the joy.**

God is our mother,

God is our father,

Christ is our brother,

the Spirit is within us.

`Dorothy McRae-McMahon, Echoes  of Our Journey, p.149, 1993`

---

God who formed the mighty ocean,

loosed the winds upon their ways,

gave the circling planets motion

in their round of ceaseless praise,

hear our thanks for hearts that love us,

for the hour that gave us birth,

heirs of starry skies above us

and the seas of all the earth.

---

Hold within your care unsleeping

all who face tempestuous seas,

harvests from the waters reaping,

God be thanked for such as these.

Earth is rich beyond all measure,

may we prize her gifts the more,

we who find our work or pleasure

on the seas or by the shore.

---

Guard, when stormy waves are breaking,

those who cross the oceans wide;

share with them their watchful waking,

be with them through wind and tide.

Christ our Savior, friend unfailing,

as the seas of life we roam,

chart our course and guide our sailing

safe to harbor and to home.

`Words Timothy Dudley Smith © 2006 Hope Publishing Company`


---

**Go out to care for God’s earth in all its varied and fragile beauty.**

We go out with trust and courage to care for the earth, our home and our children’s home.

**May the sun warm your soul and the moon be gentle above you.**

---

**May the Creator hold your hand and the Christ walk in your footsteps.**

**May the Spirit dance in your playing and grace be found in your way.**

Amen.

---

### Grace

**tapuaki’i mai me’a kai,**

for good health with all our families. Amen.
