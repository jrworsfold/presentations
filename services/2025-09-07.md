### Acknowledgement of Country

This land is God’s land and God’s Spirit dwells in the lands and waters of Waterloo and Redfern.

May we be mindful of the calling God places on humanity to care for Creation. 

---


May we take the lead from the Gadigal People, elders past and present, whose stories are entwined with the caring of this place and waters. 

**May we learn from them and walk with them towards treaty, truth telling and justice.**

---

In the name of God, who creates from dirt and stardust,

In the name of Jesus Christ, born on planet Earth,

and in the name of the Spirit who blows throughout the cosmos,

**Holy, holy, holy!**

**The Cosmos is filled with God’s presence.**

---

Christ, we come into your presence, today, 

to worship from this stardust called Earth.

**Holy, holy, holy!**

**The Cosmic Christ is here.** 

Our earth is part of the immensity of the cosmos

**Glittering galaxies high in the sky**

**radiate the splendour of God’s presence.**

---


We join millions of living species dancing with life,

**The black cockatoos, the platypus and the frog,**

**the earthworm, the blue whale and the kangaroo.**

---

We join every creature in the web of creation

**Consciously connecting with others**

**in this community called the cosmos.**

**Sing, creation, sing!**


---

Morning has broken, like the first morning

Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird

Praise for the singing, praise for the morning

Praise for them springing fresh from the Word.

---
 
Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven

Like the first dewfall, on the first grass

Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden

Sprung in completeness where His feet pass.

---
 
Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning

Born of the one light, Eden saw play

Praise with elation, praise every morning

God's recreation of the new day.

O God of Sea, of Sky, of Earth

Come hear our broken cry

Creation’s cry for life, re-birth

Oh, heal us! Breathe new life!

---

O God of seasons, God of change

God in both drought and rain

come change our hearts to end this pain

renew the Earth again 

---

We’ve ravaged species, land and sea 

We’ve squandered all your gifts 

We have not lived in harmony

Oh change us! Lord, forgive!

---

We’ve broken lives and bio-zones

With broken hearts we cry

Come heal our broken, dying home

Forgive us! Breathe new life!

---

Creating God, Incarnate Lord!

You’ve shown us how to be

life-giving! Living, breathing life!

Amen! So let us be!

---

O God of Sky, of Sea, of Earth

Of seasons and of change

come change our hearts to bring re-birth

renew your Earth again.

---

Take this saltiness and carry it with you as a reminder to bring healing and change. 

Know that nothing can separate you from the love of God. 

Your sins are forgiven.

**Thanks be to God!**

## Offering song

> *During this hymn the offering will be received*

---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; feel quite at home,

close to my heart, loved and forgiven.

Come as you are: why stand alone?


---

No need to fear, love sets no limits;

no need to fear, love never ends;

don’t run away shamed and disheartened,

rest in my love, trust me again.

---

I came to call sinners, not just the righteous;

I came to bring peace, not to condemn.

Each time you fail to live by my promise,

why do you think I’d love you the less?

---

Come as you are:  that’s how I want you.

Come as you are; trust me again.

Nothing can change the love that I bear you;

all will be well, just come as you are.

`Deidre Browne, 1936`



---

And as we come, we share a sign of peace:

The peace of the risen Christ be always with you

**And also with you.**

---

The Lord be with you

**And also with you**

Lift up your hearts

**We lift them to the Lord**

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God,

**It is right to give our thanks and praise**

---

For what, loving God do we give you thanks?

**The movement of your Spirit within our lives**

**which calls us to love you, ourselves, and one another.**

---

For what, creative God, do we give you thanks?

**Your gifts of friendship,**

**Your gifts of yourself – shown to us in Jesus.**

---

For what, compassionate God, do we give you thanks?

**The knowledge that you are with us in everything**

**In the highs and lows of our lives**

**you celebrate and grieve with us.**

---

For what, generous God, do we give you thanks?

**This meal which we are about to share.**

**This meal where you offer us not just, bread, not just wine**

**but your very self – given to us through your son Jesus**

---

Through this offering of yourself

**We can know ourselves filled, forgiven, healed, blessed**

**and made new again.**

And so, in gratitude,

we join our voices to those of the Church

on earth and in heaven:



---

**Holy, holy, holy Lord,**

**God of love, generosity and forgiveness,**

**heaven and earth are full of your glory.**

**Hosanna in the highest.**

**Blessed is the one who comes in your name.**

**Hosanna in the highest!**


---

Loving God, as we come to share the richness of your table 

we cannot forget the rawness of the earth. 

We cannot take bread and forget those who are hungry.

---

Your world is one world and we are stewards of its nourishment.

**Lord, put our prosperity at the service of the poor.**

---

We cannot take wine 

and forget those who are thirsty.

The ground and the rootless, 

the earth and its weary people cry out for justice.

**Lord, put our fullness at the service of the empty.**

---

We cannot hear your words of peace 
and forget the world at war.

**Show us quickly, Lord, how to turn weapons into welcome signs**

**and the lust for power into a desire for peace.**

---

We cannot celebrate the feast of your family and forget our divisions.

We are one in spirit, but not in fact.

History and hurt still dismember us.

**Lord, heal your church**
**in every brokenness.**

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth. \
Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best. \
For you are the heart of the kingdom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.

**God-with-Earth,**

**invited and fed at your table we are remade, repurposed.**

**May this food empower us to cherish your Creation who we also are.**

---

**And whether our cares be light or heavy, our song be strong or weak,**

**keep our hearts warm, our hands open,**

**our lives ever embracing and embraced by your love, Amen**

---

God spoke light into the void

**and the light is in our hands against the darkness.**

God clothed the world with sky

**and we ride upon the wind**

**and breath among the leaves.**

---

God gifted us with earth and with water in between.

**We dig and float and drink and grow**

**and know the power of earth and sea.**

**We paint and sing and work and dance**

**in company with God.**

---

We share the earth with all that is

in harmonies of warm and cold,

**in green and desert,**

crowd and lone,

**we feel the pain,**

---

we feel the joy.

**God is our mother,**

**God is our father,**

**Christ is our brother,**

**the Spirit is within us.**

`Dorothy McRae-McMahon, Echoes  of Our Journey, p.149, 1993`

---

Go out to care for God’s earth in all its varied and fragile beauty.

**We go out with trust and courage to care for the earth,**

**our home and our children’s home.**
