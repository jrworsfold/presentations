Lord, the light of your love is shining

in the midst of the darkness, shining

Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us

set us free by the truth you now bring us

shine on me, shine on me

---

Shine Jesus shine.

Fill this land with the Abba’s glory

Blaze, Spirit blaze, set our hearts on fire.

Flow, river, flow,

flood the nations with grace and mercy.

Send forth your word, Lord and let there be light.

---

Lord, I come to your awesome presence

from the shadows into your radiance

by your blood I may enter your brightness

search me, try me, consume all my darkness

shine on me, shine on me.

---

Shine Jesus shine.

Fill this land with the Abba’s glory

Blaze, Spirit blaze, set our hearts on fire.

Flow, river, flow,

flood the nations with grace and mercy.

Send forth your word, Lord and let there be light.

---

As we gaze on your kingly brightness

so our faces display your likeness

ever changing from glory to glory

mirrored here, may our lives tell your story

shine on me, shine on me

---

Shine Jesus shine

Fill this land with the Abba’s glory

Blaze, Spirit blaze, set our hearts on fire

Flow, river, flow,

flood the nations with grace and mercy.

Send forth your word, Lord and let there be light

You are always at Hand

Blessed are you coming near

To your church and wine and bread

Raised from soil, raised from dead

You are Holy

You are wholeness

you are present

let the cosmos press you Lord

Hallelujah,

hallelujah,

hallelujah, our Lord.

Father and Mother of us all, \
may all proclaim your worth. \
Your kingdom come, your will be honoured \
in heaven and on Earth.

---

Give us today the things we need, \
our shelter, our money, our food. \
Forgive us our debts as we agree \
to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us \
or put us to the test. \
Save us from faults or compromise \
that would rob us of our best.

---

For you are the heart of the kindom, \
your power and glory extend \
through time and space forever and ever, \
and so shall it be. Amen.
