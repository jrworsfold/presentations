Prayers

---

Father and Mother of us all, may all proclaim your worth.

Your kingdom come, your will be honoured 

in heaven and on Earth.

Give us today the things we need, 

our shelter, our money, our food. 

Forgive us our debts as we agree to treat others as you would.

---

Lead us in ways that do not tempt us or put us to the test.

Save us from faults or compromise 

that would rob us of our best.

For you are the heart of the kingdom, 

your power and glory extend

through time and space forever and ever, and so shall it be. 

Amen.
