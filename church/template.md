## Affirmation of Faith

**We believe in one God**

---

This is the place and this is the time;​

**HERE AND NOW GOD WAITS​ TO BREAK INTO OUR EXPERIENCE​**

To change our minds. To change our lives,

**TO CHANGE OUR WAYS​**

To make us see the world​. And the whole of life in a new light.​

**TO FILL US WITH HOPE, JOY ​AND CERTAINTY FOR THE FUTURE​**


---

Protect me, God,​

**You are my place of refuge.​**

I’m acknowledging you ​as the one in charge, Lord;​

**you are the best thing that’s ever happened to me.**

I delight in the company of those​ who dedicate themselves to you;

**they are the salt of the earth.​**

Those who worship other things​ will have nothing but grief.​

**I will not buy into their futile devotions;​ I will not utter the names they revere.​**

---

You are all I want, Lord, and all I need;​
you hold my future in your hands. ​
You mark out the best of everything for me;​
you’ve set me up with a bright future.​
I heap accolades on you, Lord,​
for you always give me wise advice;​
even in the dead of night​
you fill my heart with your teachings. ​

---

I’ll never be pushed off track. ​
You fill me with delight, Lord;​
joy erupts from deep in my bones;​
my body relaxes, safe in your care. ​
You set my feet on a life-giving track, Lord.​
To be in your presence is absolute bliss.​
All I could dream of comes from your hand. ​
